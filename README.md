# Extension Samples

This repository contains sample code illustrating the KubeSphere extension API. Each sample is a self-contained extension that explains one topic in [Extension Customization](https://kubesphere-dev-guide.netlify.app/extension-dev-guide/zh/extension-customization/). You can read, play with or adapt from these samples to create your own extensions.

## Prerequisites

You need to deploy the KubeSphere Development Environment first. [Deploy a container based development environment](https://kubesphere-dev-guide.netlify.app/extension-dev-guide/zh/get-started/prepare-development-environment/) using docker is a simple way.
